\title{Calculate Pairwise Sequence Similarity Matrix}
\usage{
get_similarity_psa(
  sequences,
  matrix_type = "BLOSUM62",
  gap_open = 10,
  gap_ext = 4
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sequences}{A character vector containing peptide sequences.}

\item{matrix_type}{The substitution matrix to use. Options are "BLOSUM45",
"BLOSUM50", "BLOSUM62", "BLOSUM80", "BLOSUM90", "BLOSUM100".
Default is "BLOSUM62".}

\item{gap_open}{Gap opening penalty. Default is 10.}

\item{gap_ext}{Gap extension penalty. Default is 4.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix of pairwise sequence similarities, with values
normalized between 0 and 1.
}
\description{
Calculate Pairwise Sequence Similarity Matrix
}
\details{
This function performs pairwise sequence alignment using the
Needleman-Wunsch algorithm with the specified scoring matrix and
gap penalties. Results are normalized to provide similarity scores
between 0 and 1.

\examples{
sequences <- c("HEAGAWGHEE", "PAWHEAE", "HEAGAWGHEE")
sim_matrix <- get_similarity_psa(sequences)
