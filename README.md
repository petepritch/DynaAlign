# DynaAlign - Scalable peptide sequence clustering and visualization in R

## Description

DynaAlign is an open-sourced R package designed for scalable protein sequence clustering, visualization, and consensus sequence generation, leveraging high-performance algorithms for large-scale peptide data analysis.

## Key Features

- **Scalable Algorithms:** Implements Needleman-Wunsch alignment and MinHash approximation for efficient similarity matrix computation.
- **Integration with Rcpp:** High-performance C++ implementations for critical computational processes.
- **Network-Based Clustering:** Utilizes the `igraph` package for modular clustering and visualization of sequence networks.
- **User-Friendly Outputs:** Provides consensus sequences and fine-tuned cluster sizes for downstream applications.

# Quick Start

## Installation

The package can be installed from GitHub.

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("petepritch/DynaAlign")
```

## Overview

DynaAlign addresses the challenge of clustering and analyzing large-scale peptide datasets for applications such as vaccine design and diagnostic assay development. The package integrates two primary similarity computation methods: exact sequence alignment using Needleman-Wunsch with multiple substitution matrices and an efficient, approximate MinHash-based approach. These are combined with network-based clustering via the igraph package, ensuring robust and scalable sequence clustering. Designed with performance and flexibility in mind, DynaAlign enables researchers to extract biologically meaningful insights from massive peptide datasets with unprecedented efficiency.
